# AI Renovator — Backend

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (`pip install uv` or `brew install uv`)
- Python 3.12 (uv will use it automatically if available; install via `pyenv install 3.12.0` if needed)

### 1. Clone and enter the directory

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cs5224_AI-Renovator
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This creates a `.venv` and installs all packages from `uv.lock`.

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and fill in your values:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### 4. Run the server

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.  
Interactive docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Key endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/products?q=sofa&source=ikea` | Search IKEA products |
| `GET` | `/products/{id}` | Get product detail |
| `POST` | `/products/from-url` | Scrape + normalise any furniture URL |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |

#### POST /products/from-url

```json
{ "url": "https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/klippan-loveseat-vissle-gray-s09010617/" }
```

Tries JSON-LD / OpenGraph first. Falls back to Gemini LLM extraction if structured data is incomplete. Returns a `ScrapedProduct`.

# RoomStyle: AWS Infrastructure Overview (Phase 1)

This document summarizes the initial cloud environment established for the RoomStyle project in the **Asia Pacific (Singapore) `ap-southeast-1`** region.

---

## 1. Team Access and IAM

**User Names:** ethan.wei, cleon.tan, anant.shanker, kaitlyn.goh, yash.mishra, sithanathan.rahul

| Field              | Value                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Login URL          | https://cs5224-nus.signin.aws.amazon.com/console |
| Temporary Password | `RoomStyle2026!`                                 |

> **Note:** All team members must ensure they are operating within the **Singapore (`ap-southeast-1`)** region to maintain consistency with the provisioned resources.

---

## 2. Storage (Amazon S3)

The system uses a decoupled storage layer for managing room imagery.

| Field       | Value              |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Bucket Name | `roomstyle-cs5224` |

**Bucket Structure:**

| Folder         | Purpose                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `uploads/`     | Stores raw room photos uploaded by users for design generation   |
| `generations/` | Stores final AI-rendered interior designs and project blueprints |

---

## 3. Database (Amazon RDS PostgreSQL)

A relational database handles structured application data including users, projects, and design results.

| Field              | Value             |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Database Name      | `roomstyle_db`    |
| Master Username    | `postgres_admin`  |
| Master Password    | `RoomStyle2026!`  |
| VPC Security Group | `roomstyle-db-sg` |

**Implementation:** Provisioned as a PostgreSQL instance to support the Fiscal Architect and Global Product Catalogue features.

---

## 4. Backend (Lambda and API Gateway)

The backend follows a serverless architecture using **FastAPI** and **Mangum**.

| Field        | Value                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lambda Name  | `roomstyle-backend-api`                                                                     |
| Runtime      | Python 3.12                                                                                 |
| Architecture | `arm64`                                                                                     |
| Trigger      | HTTP API                                                                                    |
| API Endpoint | `https://dopwgelhc8.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/default/roomstyle-backend-api` |

**Logic Flow:** The Lambda function acts as an orchestrator for furniture searches and room generation requests.

## Future Changes: Phase 2 Hardening

The current setup is optimised for rapid prototyping and cost-efficiency. The following changes are planned for the next phase.

### 1. Security and Authentication

- **API Gateway:** Transition from open access to JWT or IAM-based authorisation to secure the primary AI generation workflow.
- **Secrets Management:** Move database credentials and external API keys (IKEA, Taobao) into AWS Secrets Manager.
- **S3 Security:** Implement pre-signed URLs to allow secure, direct uploads from the frontend while keeping the bucket private.

### 2. Networking (VPC Strategy)

- **Private Subnets:** Relocate the RDS instance and future AI rendering engines into private subnets for enhanced security.
- **VPC Endpoints:** Establish gateway endpoints for S3 to enable internal service communication without traversing the public internet.

### 3. AI Engine and Job Queue

- **EC2 G5 Provisioning:** Deploy the AI Rendering Engine using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet on GPU-optimised instances.
- **SQS Integration:** Utilise Amazon SQS to manage the design job queue, ensuring the system can handle bursty image-generation workloads.

### 4. CI/CD and Frontend Integration

- **AWS Amplify:** Connect the GitHub repository to AWS Amplify to enable automated frontend hosting and content delivery.
- **Dependency Management:** Use Poetry to lock environment versions and ensure consistency across development and production Lambda environments.
